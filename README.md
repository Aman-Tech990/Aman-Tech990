## 👋 About Me  

I’m a **full-stack developer** driven by curiosity, discipline, and a deep respect for clean engineering.  
I enjoy working across the stack — from crafting elegant user interfaces to building reliable backend systems and integrating intelligent features.

For me, development is not a destination but a **continuous process of refinement**.  
Every day brings a new opportunity to learn, improve, and build something better than yesterday.

I’m especially passionate about writing software that is **thoughtful, efficient, and impactful**.

## 🧩 Problem Solving & DSA  

I actively work on **strengthening problem-solving skills** by practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms daily in Java**.

I regularly solve problems on platforms such as:
- **LeetCode**
- **GeeksforGeeks**

This daily practice helps me:
- Think logically and systematically  
- Write optimized and readable code  
- Improve time and space complexity awareness  
- Strengthen core computer science fundamentals  

Consistency in DSA is a key part of my growth as an engineer.
